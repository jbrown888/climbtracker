issue to solve: 

how to group grades?

eg if want to look at sport and indoor grades, consider font equiv f6b(V4) and V3-5 equally?

how to present the data?

what about larger or smaller grade ranges? eg V2-5, VB-0?
or 

also need to sort in order of increasing grades

allow comma separated multiple grades for filtering climbs 
will need new code for sorting "A" OR "B" rather than "A" AND "B" as for holds/notes/skills etc
