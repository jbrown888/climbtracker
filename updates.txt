latest update 27/8/24

- added notes into filtering for show_climbs GUI and add_attempt_climb_selection_GUI
- updated broomcupboard get_filtered_climbs accordingly
- it works!
- also ensured it separates by comma like for hold/wall/skill :
    i.e. "valley, blue" gets added to selection dict as ["valley", "blue"]
    and it will search for climbs with "valley" AND "blue in notes
